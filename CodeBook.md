## Preface
This codebook explains the following aspects of both the *allData* dataset and
the *avgSubjectActivityData* dataset:

* creation: how is it it created
* structure: what is the structure of the dataset
* meaning: what do the data mean

## Creation
Both datasets are generated by the R-script 'run_analysis.R' found in the 
repository. The script writes each dataset to a txt-file with the same name.
These files are included in the repository.  
The origin from which the datasets are generated, is downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  
It is provided in the repository in the directory 'UCI HAR Dataset' for your 
convenience.  
If you wish you can download the data directly by following this link:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung 
Galaxy S smartphone during several activities performed by a number of subjects.  
After unpacking the downloaded zip-file you can run the script *run_analysis*. 
To create the dataset *allData* the script takes the following steps:  

* read the testdata and traindata and merge these into one dataset
* add meaningful column names to the dataset
* extract data on the mean and standard deviation
* label each row with the activity

The resulting dataset is tidy. Each row specifies the mean and standard deviation 
measurements of an activity performed by a subject.  

After these steps the second dataset *avgSubjectActivityData* is created by the
*run_analysis* script based on the dataset *allData*:

* read the subject testset and the subject trainset and merge these into one
subject dataset
* create a new dataset by adding the subject dataset as a column before the 
allData dataset
* from the resulting dataset create a new dataset that contains the average of 
the measurements for each activity of a subject
* give the columns meaningful names
* reorder by subject and activity

This second dataset contains the average of all the measurements contained in 
the *allData* dataset grouped by subject and activity. The script writes this
dataset to a txt-file named 'avgSubjectActivityData.txt'. This file is also
included in the repository.

## The *allData* dataset
The *allData* dataset contains 10299 rows and 67 columns.
Each row represents measurements on 66 different aspects of an activity (which
is specified by the first column) performed by a subject.  
The table below shows the variables, their class, range and description.

## The *avgSubjectActivityData* dataset
The *avgSubjectActivityData* dataset contains 180 rows and 68 columns.
Each row represents average of the measurements on 66 different aspects of an 
activity (which is specified by the second column) performed by a subject (which 
is specified by the first column).  
Each of the 30 subjects performed 6 different activities:

* LAYING
* SITTING
* STANDING
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIR

The table below shows the variables, their class, range and description.
