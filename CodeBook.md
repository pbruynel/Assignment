Codebook for the *allData* dataset
================

This codebook explains the following aspects of the *allData* dataset:  

* creation: how is it it created
* structure: what is the structure of the dataset
* meaning: what do the data mean

## Creation
The *allData* dataset is generated by the R-script 'run_analysis.R' found in the 
repository. The script writes the dataset to a txt-file named 'allData.txt'. This 
file is included in the repository.  
The origin from which the dataset is generated, is downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  
It is provided in the repository in the directory 'UCI HAR Dataset' for your 
convenience.  
If you wish you can download the data directly by following this link:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung 
Galaxy S smartphone during several activities performed by a number of subjects.  
After unpacking the downloaded zip-file you can run the script *run_analysis*. 
To create a tidy dataset the script takes the following steps:  

* read the testdata and traindata and merge these into one dataset
* add meaningful column names to the dataset
* extract data on the mean and standard deviation
* label each row with the activity

The resulting dataset is tidy. Each row specifies the mean and standard deviation 
measurements of an activity performed by a subject.  

Besides the tidy dataset another dataset is created by the *run_analysis* script.
This second dataset is named *avgSubjectActivityData* and contains the average
of all the measurements in the *allData* dataset grouped by subject and activity.
The script writes this dataset to a txt-file named 'avgSubjectActivityData.txt'. 
This file is also included in the repository.

## Structure and meaning of the *allData* dataset
The *allData* dataset contains 10299 rows and 67 columns.
Each row represents measurements on 66 different aspects of an activity (which
is specified by the first column) performed by a subject.  
The table below shows the variables, their class, range and description.
